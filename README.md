NovaCAD opens DWG/DXF drawings natively on a Mac and renders them smoothly at
any zoom — including multi-hundred-megabyte plant layouts with millions of
entities. On top of the viewer it adds the tools you actually use during a
review: measurement, markup and drawing tools, block/attribute editing, CSV
data extraction, xref handling, aisle/travel-distance analysis, and an
optional AI Assistant that can call those tools on your drawing.

No Electron. No third-party dependencies. One Swift package, `CADCore` +
the app, with the full test suite in the open.

the synthetic fixtures in `Tests/Fixtures/` — see
[Headless snapshots](#headless-snapshots) to reproduce them.

## What it is

- A **fast viewer** for DXF (and DWG via a free converter), including xrefs,
  eTransmit ZIP packages, and folders of drawings.
- A **markup and review tool**: draw over the drawing, measure distances and
  areas, search every text string, edit blocks and attributes, and export your
  changes as DXF or CSV.
- A **data tool**: extract attributes and block data to CSV, compute
  aisle-routed travel distances, and (optionally) let an AI Assistant run
  those analyses for you.

## What it isn't

NovaCAD is not a full AutoCAD replacement and does not try to be: it writes
DXF (not DWG), has no plot/print pipeline, no LISP, no 3D modeling, and no
cloud service. See [Known limitations](#known-limitations).

## Requirements

| | |
| --- | --- |
| OS | macOS 15 (Sequoia) or later, Apple Silicon recommended (the packaged `.app`/`.pkg` is arm64) |
| Toolchain | Xcode 16+ / Swift 6.0 (only to build from source) |
| Dependencies | **None** — the package has no third-party dependencies |
| DWG support | Free [ODA File Converter](https://www.opendesign.com/guestfiles/oda_file_converter) (preferred) or GNU LibreDWG (`brew install libredwg`) |

DXF works out of the box. DWG is a proprietary format, so NovaCAD converts it
to DXF once via an external converter and caches the result.

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ryandirezze/NovaCAD-Mac.git
cd NovaCAD-Mac
swift run -c release NovaCAD      # tip: release builds parse large drawings ~10x faster
```

Then open a drawing with **File ▸ Open** (⌘O) or drag a `.dxf`, `.dwg`,
`.zip` (eTransmit), or folder onto the window. Finder double-click works too
once the app is built/installed.

### DWG files

Install the free ODA File Converter, then run it once from Finder
(right-click → Open) or clear its quarantine flag so it can run headless:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ODAFileConverter.app
```

GNU LibreDWG is supported as a fallback (`brew install libredwg`); it handles
fewer DWG versions and is less faithful than the ODA converter.

## Install as a Mac app

```sh
./Scripts/build_app.sh              # tests, builds, and installs to /Applications
./Scripts/build_pkg.sh              # builds NovaCAD-<version>.pkg for sharing
```

`swift build` and `swift run` alone do not install a Finder application.
The install script registers NovaCAD for `.dwg` and `.dxf` files, so you can
right-click a drawing and choose **Open With → NovaCAD** immediately. DWG
still requires the separate [converter setup](#dwg-files); DXF opens directly.

Prebuilt installers are attached to
[Releases](https://github.com/ryandirezze/NovaCAD-Mac/releases/latest). The
app and package are ad-hoc signed (no paid Apple Developer ID), so on first
install and first launch macOS shows an "unidentified developer" prompt —
resolve it via **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**, or
right-click → Open. The packaged build is Apple Silicon only.

### Homebrew

```sh
brew install --cask ryandirezze/tap/novacad
```

Homebrew auto-taps [`ryandirezze/tap`](https://github.com/ryandirezze/homebrew-tap),
auto-trusts only this cask, and installs only this app. The cask is bumped
automatically with each release. It lives in this personal tap rather than
Homebrew's official repository because official casks must be Apple-notarized,
which requires a paid Developer ID.

## Features

### View & navigate

- Renders LINE, CIRCLE, ARC, LWPOLYLINE (with bulges), POLYLINE (2D/3D,
  polyface meshes), SPLINE (true NURBS), ELLIPSE, SOLID, TRACE, 3DFACE, POINT,
  HATCH, TEXT, MTEXT, ATTRIB, INSERT (incl. arrays), DIMENSION, LEADER,
  ACAD_TABLE, with the full ACI palette + true color, linetypes, hatches,
  lineweights, and dark or light canvas themes.
- **Search (⌘F)**: Spotlight-style search over every text string, label,
  attribute, and block name — including resolved xref content — with
  pan/zoom animation to each hit.
- Quality control (1–5) balances detail vs. redraw speed on dense drawings;
  robust "fit" so stray far-away content can't shrink the real drawing to a
  dot.
- Multi-document tabs and trackpad gestures (pan, pinch-zoom, Option+scroll).

### Layers, xrefs & properties

- **Layers panel** — show/hide (freeze/thaw), lock/unlock, color swatches,
  entity counts, search, isolate on double-click.
- **External References pane** — show/hide each xref, flag unresolved ones,
  attach new xrefs, re-point missing xref paths, and open an xref in a new
  tab (auto-reloads when saved).
- **Properties panel** — type, layer, color, linetype, lineweight, geometry
  details, plus editing of layer/color/linetype/lineweight; fill/hatch and
  dimension-format controls where applicable.
- Selection supports click-to-accumulate (AutoCAD PICKADD), Shift to remove,
  Window/Crossing (drag direction), Option-drag Lasso, and Fence, with grip
  editing on selected objects.

### Draw, edit & markup

- Drawing tools: Line, Polyline, Circle, 3-point Arc, Rectangle, Polygon,
  Ellipse, Spline, Point, 3D Face, Text, plus linear/aligned dimensions,
  region-from-boundary, and hatch fill — with **OSNAP** (endpoint, midpoint,
  center, intersection, perpendicular, tangent) and typed coordinate input
  (`100,50`, `@25,0`, length-along-cursor).
- Modify toolset: Move, Copy, Rotate, Scale, Mirror, **Trim, Extend, Fillet,
  Chamfer, Offset, Stretch, Array, Explode, Join**, Erase/Delete — all
  undoable (⌘Z / ⇧⌘Z), and cross-document copy/paste.
- Markup layer: classic draw tools place markup on a `NOVACAD-MARKUP` layer
  in a pickable color so proposed changes read clearly against the original
  drawing.
- **Command palette** at the bottom: type `L`, `PL`, `C`, `A`, `REC`, `POL`,
  `T`, `E`, `DI`, `AREA`, `TR`, `EX`, `F`, `O`, `AR`, `X`, `J`, `Z`, `U`, …,
  with interactive "Select objects:" prompts (`W`/`C`/`F`, `ALL`, `P`, `L`).
- Block tools: insert blocks (true INSERT entities), stamp an existing block
  by picking it, and edit block attributes in a dedicated editor
  (ATTDEF/ATTEDIT).

### Save & export

- **Save (⌘S) / Save As (⇧⌘S)** write the full live document — every
  in-session edit, including modified or deleted original entities — back to
  DXF via the structural writer. Documents opened from DWG save as DXF.
- **Export Markup as DXF…** produces a standalone markup file you can attach
  as an xref over the master drawing.
- **Save Copy with Markup…** writes a byte-faithful copy of the original DXF
  with the markup merged in.
- **Data Extraction** exports attributes/block data to CSV and imports edits
  back from CSV, with a column picker.

> Note: the two *markup* exporters cover the primitive markup set. Block
> stamps and hatch markup are fully preserved by Save/Save As, but may be
> omitted from Export Markup / Save Copy, and stamped blocks are not restored
> by Reload.

### AI Assistant (optional)

A floating chat panel that can answer questions about the open drawing and,
on supported backends, call 18 built-in drawing tools (read entities,
extract attributes, propose attribute edits, analyze/repair aisle networks,
route travel distances, shade aisle/dock areas, export CSVs, and more).
Edits and geometry are **staged for your review** — nothing is applied to the
drawing until you click Apply.

| Provider | API | Tool-calling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anthropic | Messages API | ✅ |
| OpenAI-compatible | Chat Completions | Chat only |
| OpenCode CLI | one-shot `opencode run` | Chat only |
| OpenCode server (agentic) | local `opencode serve` | ✅ |

The OpenCode server backend additionally needs the `opencode` CLI and
`npm install @opencode-ai/plugin` in its workspace (the app tells you if it's
missing and runs text-only otherwise). **Privacy:** when you enable the AI
Assistant, drawing content (entity summaries, attributes, computed values) is
sent to the provider you configure.

### Headless snapshots

Render a PNG without opening the UI — useful for scripting and batch
previews:

```sh
.build/release/NovaCAD --snapshot out.png [--size WxH] [--space paper] [--light] \
    [--focus x,y,w,h] [--select x,y] [--quality 1-5] <drawing.dxf|.dwg|.zip|folder>
```

`--focus` zooms to a world-coordinate rectangle; `--select` hit-tests a world
point and renders it highlighted; `--debug-bounds` prints culling statistics.
PNG output is rendered at 2× the requested `--size` for crisp README/social
images. Additional flags (`--exec`, `--compare`, `--roundtrip`, …) exist for
automation and the project's own verification harnesses.

## Xrefs & eTransmit

- Open an eTransmit ZIP directly: it's extracted, the main drawing is
  detected, and nested xrefs resolve from the package.
- Open a folder of drawings or a single file; xrefs resolve from sibling
  files, with `XREFNAME|layer` entries in the Layers panel.
- Missing xrefs are flagged; you can re-point them or bind xrefs in AutoCAD
  before export.

## Performance

NovaCAD is built for large industrial drawings: a byte-level streaming DXF
parser (no full-file string conversion) feeds an asynchronous, coalescing
CoreGraphics render pipeline with render-time level-of-detail, so geometry is
decimated to screen resolution and sub-pixel entities collapse to
deduplicated ticks. Pan/zoom stays responsive on multi-million-entity
drawings.

Rather than quoting benchmark numbers, measure on your own hardware — the
headless snapshot CLI prints parse and render timings:

```sh
.build/release/NovaCAD --snapshot /tmp/out.png your-drawing.dxf
```

## Architecture

<img src="docs/images/architecture.svg" width="100%" alt="NovaCAD architecture diagram">

Two targets, one package: **CADCore** (streaming DXF parser, geometry/NURBS,
block and layer resolution, DWG→DXF bridge) is a self-contained library;
**DWGViewer** is the macOS app (renderer, canvas, panels, editing, command
palette, AI Assistant). The headless snapshot mode uses the same pipeline the
UI does.

## Building & testing

```sh
swift build                 # compile
swift test                  # 1,200+ XCTest cases
swift run -c release NovaCAD
./Scripts/build_app.sh      # release .app → /Applications
./Scripts/build_pkg.sh      # distributable .pkg
```

Test fixtures are small synthetic DXF files under `Tests/Fixtures/`; tests
that exercise very large real-world drawings look for them via
`NOVACAD_SAMPLE_LAYOUT` and skip when it isn't set.

## Use CADCore in your project

CADCore — the streaming DXF parser and 2D geometry library — is published as
a library product of this package, so other Swift projects can reuse it:

```swift
// Package.swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ryandirezze/NovaCAD-Mac.git", from: "1.2.3"),
],
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourTarget",
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "CADCore", package: "NovaCAD-Mac"),
        ]
    ),
]
```

```swift
import CADCore

let document = try DXFParser.parse(url: drawingURL)
print(document.layers.count, document.unitsLabel)
```

Requires macOS 15+ and adds no further dependencies.

## Known limitations

- Writes **DXF only** — native DWG writing requires the licensed ODA SDK.
- No plot/print pipeline; no LISP; no 3D modeling or orbit views (2D canvas
  with a high-performance CoreGraphics pipeline).
- `Export Markup as DXF` / `Save Copy with Markup` cover the primitive markup
  set (see the note under Save & export).
- The AI Assistant is optional and requires your own provider/credentials;
  tool-calling needs the Anthropic or OpenCode server backend.
- The packaged app is ad-hoc signed (Gatekeeper prompt on first run) and
  Apple Silicon only.
- DXF is a large format: uncommon entities render as their nearest
  supported representation or are skipped with diagnostics.
